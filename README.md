# Agentic AI Workflows Gallery

Welcome to the Agentic AI Workflows Gallery‚Äîa collection of practical, production-grade examples demonstrating the power and flexibility of agent-based AI and LLM orchestration.

This repository brings together modular, real-world examples that leverage state-of-the-art frameworks such as [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/) and open-source toolkits to solve end-to-end tasks with autonomous, tool-using agents.

## üöÄ What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to the use of autonomous, goal-driven software agents‚Äîpowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized tools‚Äîto automate complex workflows, reason, collaborate, and take action in digital environments.

With agentic workflows, you can build systems that:
- **Plan** and execute multi-step processes,
- **Invoke external APIs/tools** as part of their reasoning,
- **Chain tasks** across agents for robust automation,
- **Provide explainable outputs** with clear traceability.
