# Agentic AI Workflows Gallery

Welcome to the Agentic AI Workflows Gallery‚Äîa collection of practical, production-grade examples demonstrating the power and flexibility of agent-based AI and LLM orchestration.

This repository brings together modular, real-world examples that leverage state-of-the-art frameworks such as [CrewAI](https://crewai.com/), [Google Agents Development Kit (ADK)](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), and [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) to solve end-to-end tasks with autonomous, tool-using agents.

## üöÄ What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to the use of autonomous, goal-driven software agents‚Äîpowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialized tools‚Äîto automate complex workflows, reason, collaborate, and take action in digital environments.

With agentic workflows, you can build systems that:
- **Plan** and execute multi-step processes,
- **Invoke external APIs/tools** as part of their reasoning,
- **Chain tasks** across agents for robust automation,
- **Provide explainable outputs** with clear traceability.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. **Clone this repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-workflows.git
cd agentic-ai-workflows
```

### 2. **Browse the examples**
```bash
ls
# Each subfolder is a self-contained workflow example.
```

### 3. **Run an example**
- Follow the instructions in each example‚Äôs `README.md`.
- Most require Python 3.9+, and some require OpenAI or other LLM API keys.
